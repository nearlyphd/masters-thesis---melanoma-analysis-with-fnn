    "__Melanoma__, also redundantly known as __malignant melanoma__, is a type of skin cancer that develops from the pigment-producing cells known as melanocytes. Melanomas typically occur in the skin, but may rarely occur in the mouth, intestines, or eye (uveal melanoma). In women, they most commonly occur on the legs, while in men, they most commonly occur on the back. About 25% of melanomas develop from moles. Changes in a mole that can indicate melanoma include an increase in size, irregular edges, change in color, itchiness, or skin breakdown."

Those with many moles, a history of affected family members, and poor immune function are at greater risk. A number of rare genetic conditions, such as xeroderma pigmentosum, also increase the risk.

Australia and New Zealand have the highest rates of melanoma in the world. High rates also occur in Northern Europe and North America, while it is less common in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

The main advantage of this approach is that it can be applied on datasets containing images with different resolutions since the output features are given in relation to the scale instead of being absolute values. This algorithm consists in placing a box $\\beta_{i}$ sized $𝐿 × 𝐿$ on the left superior corner of the image, wherein 𝐿 is given in pixels. This box glides through the image, one column and then one row at a time. After reaching the end of the image, the box is repositioned at the starting point and the value of 𝐿 is increased by 2."

    "The ISIC Archive is an open source platform with publicly available images of skin lesions under Creative Commons licenses. The images are associated with ground-truth diagnoses and other clinical metadata. Images can be queried using faceted search and downloaded individually or in batches. The initial focus of the archive has been on dermoscopy images of individual skin lesions, as these images are inherently standardized by the use of a specialized acquisition device and devoid of many of the privacy challenges associated with clinical images. To date, the images have been provided by specialized melanoma centers from around the world. The archive is designed to accept contributions from new sources under the Terms of Use and welcomes new contributors. There are ongoing efforts to supplement the dermoscopy images in the archive with close-up clinical images and a broader representation of skin types. The images in the Archive are used to support educational efforts through linkage with Dermoscopedia and are used for Grand Challenges and Live Challenges to engage the computer science community for the development of diagnostic AI."
