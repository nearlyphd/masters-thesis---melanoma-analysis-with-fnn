    "__Melanoma__, also redundantly known as __malignant melanoma__, is a type of skin cancer that develops from the pigment-producing cells known as melanocytes. Melanomas typically occur in the skin, but may rarely occur in the mouth, intestines, or eye (uveal melanoma). In women, they most commonly occur on the legs, while in men, they most commonly occur on the back. About 25% of melanomas develop from moles. Changes in a mole that can indicate melanoma include an increase in size, irregular edges, change in color, itchiness, or skin breakdown."

Those with many moles, a history of affected family members, and poor immune function are at greater risk. A number of rare genetic conditions, such as xeroderma pigmentosum, also increase the risk. Diagnosis is by biopsy and analysis of any skin lesion that has signs of being potentially cancerous."

Australia and New Zealand have the highest rates of melanoma in the world. High rates also occur in Northern Europe and North America, while it is less common in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In the United States, melanoma occurs about 1.6 times more often in men than women. Melanoma has become more common since the 1960s in areas mostly populated by people of European descent."

The initial focus of the archive has been on dermoscopy images of individual skin lesions, as these images are inherently standardized by the use of a specialized acquisition device and devoid of many of the privacy challenges associated with clinical images. To date, the images have been provided by specialized melanoma centers from around the world. The archive is designed to accept contributions from new sources under the Terms of Use and welcomes new contributors. There are ongoing efforts to supplement the dermoscopy images in the archive with close-up clinical images and a broader representation of skin types. The images in the Archive are used to support educational efforts through linkage with Dermoscopedia and are used for Grand Challenges and Live Challenges to engage the computer science community for the development of diagnostic AI."
